# Elegant Swarm MVP candidate: "Founder bricks"

**North-Star:** Our long game is **self-driving startups**: a fleet of AI agents that ideate, validate, build, launch, and optimise with minimal human nudges.

## MVP
- This *MVP* would productise a subset of our agentic units early to generate multi-case traction (shallower and more systematic than a single anchor case).
- **The MVP is 1. a standalone webapp, 2. a Slack bot, or 3. updating Notion via API
- Package below is a combination of several features (see library at the end of this document). Other combinations are possible.

- Creates self-optimising feedback loop: wording, CTA and audience segments auto-tuned from live data  

### Common themes in the MVP

1. **Describe your idea** in plain language.  
2. **AI asks** the next-most-impactful question until your case is clear (or you're out of info)
3. **Agents create assets**, anything from Lean Canvas, stakeholder personas, competitive research, agentic case scrutiny, to your landing page(s), and prompts for product builder
3. **AI requests clarification** Each agent requests the most impactful clarifications needed to improve their output
5. **You're ready** to build, distribute, pivot, or kill

### Who is this MVP for?
Solo or 2‑person founder in **explore / validate** phase, €100–200 discretionary budget, aiming to decide **execute, pivot, or kill** fast.

## Questions for user interviews on MVP

* "Which flavor resonates the most - and why?"
* "Your thoughts: Who would use this when?"  
* "How much would you pay (one-off) or on a monthly subscription for each of the feature candidates below?"
* "Which feature candidates need to be in the MVP to make you a paying customer?"

### Baseline capabilities
