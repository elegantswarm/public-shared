# Elegant Swarm MVP

## North-Star

- Our long game is **self-driving startups**: a fleet of AI agents that ideate, validate, build, launch, and optimise with minimal human nudges.
- The *MVP* is the first rung on that ladder—productising the *strategy* phase so founders reach conviction (or fail fast) in hours, not months.

## MVP flavors

#### Foundational Knowledge Base  
- In 2 h auto-creates Lean Canvas, personas, market sizing, simple financials, competitive overview & best-practice docs  
- Target: zero-to-execution founders who need a single source of truth for teammates and investors  
- Acts as living backbone: every later agent and module reads & writes to this KB, eliminating doc sprawl  

#### Prompt Pack Studio  
- Generates brand-consistent, high-quality prompts for Lovable, v0.dev, Mixo, Pitch in seconds  
- Target: non-technical founders or designers who rely on AI builders but hate iterative tweaking  
- Outcome: 90 %+ first-pass fidelity, hours saved, reusable prompt library that auto-updates with brand changes  

#### 48-Hour Validation Crash-Kit  
- One click spins up landing page, traffic ads, cold-emails and five user interviews; delivers Go/No-Go report in 2 days  
- For idea-stage founders who need real signal before spending €1 000+ on build  
- Cuts typical 3-week discovery loop to a weekend, providing objective demand, CAC and quote snippets  

#### Pricing Confidence Engine  
- Scrapes rival pricing, models CAC/LTV bands, A/B tests draft tiers, outputs data-backed recommendations  
- Ideal for pre-launch / early-revenue SaaS teams terrified of under- or overpricing  
- Prevents costly guesswork, produces ready-to-ship pricing page copy & justification deck slide  

#### Idea-to-Landing AutoFlow  
- Turns a raw idea description into a live Mixo landing page (copy, imagery, analytics) in <10 min  
- Freemium wedge for brainstorming founders who want early sign-ups while still refining concept  
- Bridges discovery → validation and seeds Growth-Loop Starter with captured leads  

#### Prototype-to-User-Test Sprint (72 h)  
- Auto-prompts Lovable/v0 to build clickable prototype, recruits 25 synthetic users + optional real testers, iterates once  
- For PMs/founders needing UX evidence without in-house design resources  
- Delivers heat-maps, dropout analytics and a prioritised fix list—compressing a 3-week sprint into three days  

#### Growth-Loop Starter  
- Generates 30-day social drip, variants landing pages, pipes leads into CRM, auto-reports daily funnel metrics  
- Perfect for first-user acquisition when budget <€500 and no marketer onboard  
- Creates self-optimising feedback loop: wording, CTA and audience segments auto-tuned from live data  

#### Launch-Day Orchestrator  
- Schedules and posts coordinated Product Hunt, Hacker News, X, LinkedIn blasts; GPT agent replies to comments in brand voice  
- Audience: teams entering public launch who want day-one buzz without an agency  
- Yields post-mortem with reach, sign-ups, channel ROI—turnkey “launch as a service” in one dashboard  

### Common themes in the MVP

1. **Describe your idea** in plain language.  
2. **AI asks** the next-most-impactful question until your case is clear (or you're out of info)
3. **Agents create assets**, anything from Lean Canvas, stakeholder personas, competitive research, agentic case scrutiny, to your landing page(s), and prompts for product builder
3. **AI requests clarification** Each agent requests the most impactful clarifications needed to improve their output
5. **You're ready** to build, distribute, pivot, or kill

### Who is this MVP for?
Solo or 2‑person founder in **explore / validate** phase, €100–200 discretionary budget, aiming to decide **execute, pivot, or kill** fast.

## Questions for user interviews on MVP

* "Which flavor resonates the most - and why?"
* "Your thoughts: Who would use this when?"  
* "How much would you pay (one-off) or on a monthly subscription for each of the feature candidates below?"
* "Which feature candidates need to be in the MVP to make you a paying customer?"

## Under the hood

### Baseline capabilities
| Baseline element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Adaptive onboarding | 30-minute, branching Q&A that captures the raw idea, founder context and goals; every next question is selected for maximal information gain, and the answers seed the Knowledge Base. |
| Clarification loop | After agents process the interview, the system surfaces missing or ambiguous data as short follow-up prompts; once the founder responds, all downstream documents are refreshed automatically. |
| Knowledge base | A read-only Notion-style interface to browse pages and assets. Most features below are represented as page |
